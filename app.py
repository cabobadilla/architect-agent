           - Operational procedures and monitoring
           - Risk management and quality assurance
           - Change and release management

        3. People & Organization (in the 'people' field):
           - Team structure and responsibilities
           - Required skills and learning curve
           - Collaboration and communication patterns
           - Cultural and organizational impact

           - Trade-offs and their justification
           - Implementation strategy and timeline
           - Cost implications and ROI considerations
